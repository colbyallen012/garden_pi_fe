## Summary

*GardenPi* is a mobile app for plant and gardening lovers who wish they had more control over their garden.  As you may have guessed, this repository pairs with the [*GardenPi* back-end repository](https://github.com/Mycobee/garden_pi_be) & [*GardenPi* Python](https://github.com/Mycobee/garden_python) to create a complete application and connect the user to their garden in situations where it was previously impossible.  *GardenPi* not only allows a user to monitor their beloved plants soil moisture saturation by most recent, last five recordings, and over the course of a week... It also allows the user to water their garden remotely via the 'Water Garden' button.  Additionally, weather data is displayed under the *GardenPi* logo so the user is made aware of current and upcoming conditions.   

### Learning Goals 

1.  Build a fully functional and fully tested React-Native application.
2.  Use an agile process to work with a back end team 
3.  Get experience with back end languages such as Python and Ruby on Rails.
4.  Work with hardware and connect it to the back end data base
5.  Practice an advanced, professional git workflow
6.  Gain more experience using TravisCI
